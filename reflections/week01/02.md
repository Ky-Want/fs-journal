## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
- A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state. Some common ones are :link , :visited , :hover , and :active.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
- Specificity is like a ranking system for elements. It determines the property weight of said elements and can be used to alter the order in which things are presented in our code. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
- It disrupts the natural flow in applying the css rules where in properties are applied from top to bottom. !important makes the thing it's attached to override everything else and can make it difficult to manage the code if someone else is working on the same code as you. It can also override things that need to come before it, which could make the site crash.
