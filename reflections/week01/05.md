# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? So far my learning has been going smoothly, which is nice.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise? I learned how easy it can be to use padding, margin, and shadows. I didn't understand it previously and was surprised at how easy it is to use.

- What are you struggling with? I'm still struggling to understand flex boxes and how to use them to properly position things in webpages.

- What would you count as a victory? I count my deeper understanding of code my victory since my sole goal for this course is to learn everything I can about coding so that I can be successful as a developer.
