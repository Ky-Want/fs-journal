## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
- Wireframing creates a skeletal outline of a webpage that give developers a visual guide for the webpages they're making.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
- Low-fidelity wireframes: useful for starting conversations, deciding on navigation layout, and mapping the user flow.
- Mid-fidelity wireframes: useful for including more details while still avoiding distractions
- High-fidelity wireframes: the added detail of high-fidelity is ideal for exploring and documenting complex concepts such as menu systems or interactive maps

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
- Yes, because having a visual guide makes developing many times easier. When you have a wireframe to follow you have less to keep in mind.
