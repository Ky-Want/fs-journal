## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

- We use git to save our work in a place outside our local storage, preventing the loss of any of our work. We also use it as a way to easily share our work with others.


2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

- Multiple branches allow us to work on multiple things for a single project at once and later merge the project into one, this makes it easier for multiple people to work on one project as well as keep track of any bugs that occur since they'll be in a separate branch away from the main code.


3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

- GitHub is a code hosting platform, whereas Git is a tool used for source code management.
