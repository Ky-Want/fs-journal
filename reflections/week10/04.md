## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
- An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it. Common examples include compass directions (values of NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST) and the days of the week.

2. How can you modify an Enum?
- You can add a new value to a column of data type enum using ALTER MODIFY command. If you want the existing value of enum, then you need to manually write the existing enum value at the time of adding a new value to column of data type enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
- I've used enums to give an object in an array multiple types, for example I assigned the various D&D class to "classes" for a GM helper application.
