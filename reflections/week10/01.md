## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
- A data type as the name suggests is the type or category to which the data belongs to. It is an attribute of the data which defines the type of data an object can hold. In SQL the data type defines the type of data to be stored in each column of the table. Each column has its own data type. It is important to specify the data type of all columns so that similar values can be added to it.  This means one column can hold only one type of data.
- String/Character Datatype: uses text
- Numeric Datatype: uses int, or numbers
- Date and Time Datatype:	DATE is one of the five temporal data types provided by MySQL for managing dates. It can store the date in the YYYY-MM-DD format. Dates within the range from â€˜1000-01-01â€™ to â€˜9999-12-31â€™ can be stored. But if you want to store dates apart from this range you can use other non-temporal formats such as INT.
EXAMPLE: 2020-10-24.

TIME is used for storing the time of a day. The time can be stored in the hh:mm:ss format only. Also, you can enter time within the range from â€˜-838:59:59â€™ to â€˜838:59:59â€™. It can have fractional seconds part that is up to microseconds precision (6 digits).
EXAMPLE: 09:00:00



2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
- A data type is a value type if it holds the data within its own memory allocation. Value types include the following: All numeric data types. Boolean , Char , and Date.
- C# provides the following built-in value types, also known as simple types: Integral numeric types. Floating-point numeric types. bool that represents a Boolean value.


3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
- Unlike value types, a reference type doesn't store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.
- Variables of reference types store references to their data (objects), while variables of value types directly contain their data. With reference types, two variables can reference the same object; therefore, operations on one variable can affect the object referenced by the other variable.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers): A floating point number, is a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. For example, 5.5, 0.25, and -103.342 are all floating point numbers, while 91, and 0 are not. Floating point numbers get their name from the way the decimal point can "float" to any position necessary.
