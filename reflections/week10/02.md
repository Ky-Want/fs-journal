## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?
- A list in C# is a collection of strongly typed objects. These objects can be easily accessed using their respective index. Index calling gives the flexibility to sort, search, and modify lists if required. In simple, List in C# is the generic version of the ArrayList.



2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

A method is a code block that contains a series of statements. A program causes the statements to be executed by calling the method and specifying any required method arguments. In C#, every executed instruction is performed in the context of a method.
- Add( T ) This method is used to add an object at the end of the list.
<!-- - Clear() This method is used to remove all the elements from the list. -->
<!-- - Insert( Int32, T ) This method is used to insert an element at the specified position in the list. -->
- RemoveAt( Int32 ).
- and Sort() seem like methods I might use often due to the types of projects I often work on/create.



3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
- You can do add while iterating through the elements and get the individual element as well.
- Suppose you have

List<string> listname = new List<string)();
foreach(var item in items)  //items is list of collections which is IEnumerable
{

// item is individual object from the list
listname.Add(item.Name);   //assuming item has a property called Name
}
