## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
- A row is a horizontal alignment of data, while a column is vertical. Data in a row contains information that describes a single entity, while data in a column describes a field of information all entities possess. Objects placed in a row typically face forward, while objects in a column are aligned head to tail.




2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Characters

(
  - id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  - name VARCHAR(255),
  - age VARCHAR(255),
  - description VARCHAR(255)

)




3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- If you donâ€™t want to remove table structure or youâ€™re only deleting specific rows, use the DELETE command. It can remove one, some, or all rows in a table. DELETE returns the number of rows removed from the table.
However, DELETE uses a row lock during execution and can be rolled back. Every deleted row is locked, so it will require a lot of locks if youâ€™re working in a large table.
DELETE also keeps the auto-increment ID in the table. If you remove the last record in the table with ID=20 and then add a new record, this record will have ID=21 â€“ even though the record immediately before it will be ID=19.
DELETE can be executed by triggers. A trigger can be called before, after, or instead of the DELETE operation. It can be executed for any row change or when all rows are removed. Removing rows in another table can also trigger DELETE.

- The DROP TABLE operation removes the table definition and data as well as the indexes, constraints, and triggers related to the table.
This command frees the memory space.
No triggers are fired when executing DROP TABLE.
This operation cannot be rolled back in MySQL, but it can in Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
In SQL Server, DROP TABLE requires ALTER permission in the schema to which the table belongs; MySQL requires the DROP privilege; Oracle the requires the DROP ANY TABLE privilege. In PostgreSQL, users can drop their own tables.
