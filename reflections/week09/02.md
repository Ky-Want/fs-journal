## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?
- GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?
- Automate everything within the GitHub flow: Actions gives you the ability to implement powerful automation's right in your repositories. You can create your own actions or use readily available actions on the GitHub Marketplace to integrate your preferred tools right into your repository.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
- A workflow is triggered (or initiated) when a contact meets a specific condition, such as opening an email, completing a signup form, or clicking a specific link in an email campaign. Based on the features available in your account, you can create workflows with these types of triggers: rules, timer, or API. 
- In trigger-action programming, end users specify the behavior of a system as an event (trigger) and corresponding action to be taken whenever that event occurs. Both the trigger and the action can contain parameters that customize their behavior.
