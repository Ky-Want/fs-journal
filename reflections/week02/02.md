## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
- Function Declaration, this one defines a named function:

function name(parameters){ statements }

- Function Expressions. Defines a named or anonymous function (a function that has no name):

let name = function(parameters) { statements }

- Arrow Function Expression, it's a shorter syntax for writing function expressions. They do not create their own ***this*** value.

let name = (parameters) => { statements }



2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are used when defining a function, while arguments are the values the function receives from each parameter.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
A higher-order function is when a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function. A couple examples are...
- Array.prototype.map

and

- Array.prototype.filter
