## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The Elements tab allows you to directly look at and manipulate the HTML elements and CSS on the DOM â€“ what you change in this tab will be immediately and directly updated in the page you are viewing.

The Console tab allows you to run JavaScript, view errors, and log messages.

The Sources tab allows you to view all of your source files, add breakpoints in your code, and debug your code line by line.

The Network tab allows you to view your network requests in detail, as well as the responses that youâ€™ve received back.

The Application tab allows you to view your Local Storage and the cookies you have saved to your computer. It also provides you with the ability to delete cookies among other things.



2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab, and it can be useful for debugging because it doesn't save things unless you modify your code as well, that way you can test and figure out whats wrong without making a mess of your actual code.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Another good way to debug code is to use the JavaScript Debugging pane, also commonly referred to as the 'Debugger'.
