## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

If you plan before starting to write code you will more than likely end up with higher-quality written content. Unplanned things are much easier to mess up and will almost always have to be changed later.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When I'm stuck I either talk through the process of whatever I'm doing or find the answer from google if walking myself through the process is insufficient.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
- planning too much can be bad.
- Not using encapsulation often leads to harder to maintain systems.
- It's better to always leave code a bit cleaner than when you started working with it (though I already kind of do this with my code)
