## Questions

1. What is Scope? 
- Scope is where variables are available for use.

2. What is Hoisting?
- Hoisting is where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- let is basically the better version of var, so in general it would be better to define things with let when you want to define something that's definition could or later will be changed.
- If you want the variable to stay the same and be unable to be re-declared you may want to use const.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- My takeaway from this assignment is that there are both global and local Scopes, the difference being that one is a variable stored outside a function while the other is stored inside a function block.
