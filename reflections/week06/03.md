## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
- I've utilized lifecycle hooks to "hook into" the react state and lifecycle features from function components.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
- The mounted() hook is the most commonly used lifecycle hook in Vue. Vue calls the mounted() hook when your component is added to the DOM. It is most often used to send an HTTP request to fetch data that the component will then render.
