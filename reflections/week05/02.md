## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
- There are three types of relationships, and each influences how we love each other and ourselves: traditional relationships, conscious relationships, and transcendent relationships.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
- In the one to one relationship Embedding is the preferred way to model the relationship as itâ€™s more efficient to retrieve the document, however an advantage Linking has is that additional comments will not grow the original Blog Post document, making it less likely that the applications will run in the maximum document size of 16 MB. Itâ€™s also much easier to return paginated comments as the application can slice and dice the comments more easily.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
- Letâ€™s take the category drama that might have thousands of books in it and with many new books consistently being added and removed. This makes it impracticable to embed all the books in a category document. Each book, however, can easily have categories embedded within it, as the rate of change of categories for a specific book might be very low.
