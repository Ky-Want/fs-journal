## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
- Postman, Vue tools, and the dom.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
- The DOM, and because of the console log. If we put enough try catches in the code the console will tell us whats wrong with a good amount of accuracy.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
- Vue tools, and not necessarily because they're the least useful, but I just haven't gotten around to using it much.
