## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
- Code documentation is text that accompanies software code to explain what your code is doing, why it's written the way it is, and/or how to use it. There are two main categories of documentation: documentation inside the code and supporting documentation about the code.

- choosing good names for variables and functions,
- leaving brief comments within the code to help give context to future readers,
- adding illustrative images such as sequence and entity relationship diagrams,
- providing API docs, describing each class, method, argument and return value,
- and using a statically typed language, such as TypeScript (types as documentation) are some of the ways to document code.



2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
- Mental Save Points: 
Documentation is like a mental save point for those times when you finally get what's going on at the end of the day and don't want to lose momentum. Well documented code will ensure that when you need to dive back in tomorrow morning (or several months from now), you won't have to take as much time getting up to speed.

- Documented code gets reused: 
The difference between a used library and an unused library often comes down to its documentation.

Who wants to use an undocumented open-source library or contribute to an undocumented project? Almost no one.

In most cases, you'd rather use a less powerful library that has docs. Why? Because the documentation conveys other points of information about a codebase. The developers believe that the project is worth the time and energy to write about it in plain language so anyone who might be interested can quickly get started and learn how it works, and why key decisions were made.



3. How important is Code documentation and why?
- Documentation can include anything from code comments to user manuals, and it's an essential part of any software project. It helps future developers understand the code and makes it easier for them to maintain and update. Good documentation can also help you learn from your mistakes, so you won't repeat them.
