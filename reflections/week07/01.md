## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
- Pair programming is a practice in agile software development where two programmers share a workstation. This includes a single computer. One programmer (called the driver) writes the code while the other (the observer) watches, reviews, and provides guidance. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
- Fewer bugs and mistakes. When software developers work alone, they can fall victim to many problems. 
- Greater resilience. Every software development team should consider this factor in their projects: 
- Improved code quality. 
- Faster training. 
- Better team morale. 
- Better knowledge sharing.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
- Higher development costs. The idea of having two developers working on a single task at the same time seems like a waste of valuable resources. 
- Sustainability. It's common knowledge that pair programming is unsustainable enough to be practiced all the time.
