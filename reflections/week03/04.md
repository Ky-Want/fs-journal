## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
- Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
- The Subject interface defines the three methods necessary to comply with this pattern: attach , detach , and notify . The attach and detach methods receive the observer as a parameter that will be added or removed in the Subject data structure.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
- Observer design pattern is useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change. In observer pattern, the object that watch on the state of another object are called Observer and the object that is being watched is called Subject.
