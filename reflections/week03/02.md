## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
- Encapsulation allows us to control and validate the data. In JavaScript, variables resemble data. Encapsulation means information hiding i.e. the idea that the internal entities of an object should not be directly bare as public entities. This will help restrict the unauthorized use of the variables.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
-  If you actually need encapsulation, both closures and class fields are far better than underscores, because they don‚Äôt rely on convention, and instead enforce true encapsulation.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
- We may use the ‚Äúthis‚Äù keyword to make method (function) calls to stick to the main method itself which thus makes the variables private. The main idea for using the ‚Äúthis‚Äù keyword is just to make things directly visible that is making methods directly accessible
