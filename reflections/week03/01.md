## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve? 
- The export statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export objects, functions, variables from the module so they can be used by other programs with the help of the import statements.

2. How does export differ from export default?
- Export { variable as default } exports the reference to the exported variable , whereas with export default variable , the importing modules do not receive the reference to the exported variable.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
- Maintainability: By definition, a module is self-contained. A well-designed module aims to lessen the dependencies on parts of the codebase as much as possible, so that it can grow and improve independently. Updating a single module is much easier when the module is decoupled from other pieces of code.
