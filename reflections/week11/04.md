## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- I've greatly enjoyed coding here, all of the instructors are amazing and I've learned significantly more than I feel I would have if I had tried just learning everything on my own. There have been some frustrating moments, mostly just when my time was wasted or when I wasn't given the help I felt I needed, but I had a lot of fun with the lectures (even when I was struggling to just stay awake), and I really enjoyed the partner programming sessions. I probably should have gone to get help more often, but I feel like codeworks makes the knowledge we need to succeed accessible enough that even if we don't go to the instructors we can still pass if we have enough motivation. I am worried I won't pass the final and will lose my chance to get the certificate. I know we were told that at this point we have the knowledge we need whether we pass or not, but not having the certificate and recommendation will make getting a job as a developer much more difficult. It worries me because I've invested literally everything into this and want to get into developing professionally more than anything right now, and if I don't I'll be SOL. Getting a third chance at life is very unlikely in my opinion. As for time management I plan to work on the final for an hour and take a 15 minute break before continuing as was suggested.
