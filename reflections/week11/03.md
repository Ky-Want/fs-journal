## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?
- A SQL injection is when criminal hackers enter malicious commands into web forms, like the search field, login field, or URL, of an unsecure website to gain unauthorized access to sensitive and valuable data.


2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?
- Error-based SQL Injections obtain information about the database structure from error messages issued by the database server. In rare circumstances, an attacker may enumerate an entire database using only error-based SQL injection.
In SQL Injections labs, if you type ?id=1 in the URL and press enter, it gives you the login name and password.

- Union-based SQL Injections use the UNION SQL operator to aggregate the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result, which is subsequently returned as part of the HTTP response.

- And Boolean-based SQL Injection works by submitting a SQL query to the database and forcing the application to produce a different response depending on whether the query returns TRUE or FALSE.




3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?
- Routine application database audits should be used to determine if your application has been compromised. Querying the database for common HTML tags used by worms can reveal signs that the application is spreading malware. These tags include "iframe", "http-equiv="refresh"" or the IP address of known malicious servers. An easier way to detect a compromise is by examining webpages created from dynamic content for unexpected behavior, including the addition of hidden iframes -- code elements used to embed an HTTP document in another HTTP document -- in the HTML. These routine audits help detect a compromised system, but this method only allows for fixes to be created after the fact. Recovering an application from an exploited state, especially when data may have been altered, can be an extremely costly process and does not prevent future attacks.
- Developers can prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web applications by utilizing parameterized database queries with bound, typed parameters and careful use of parameterized stored procedures in the database. This can be accomplished in a variety of programming languages including Java, .NET, PHP, and more.
