## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
- Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in C# by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.

Important terminology:

- Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).
- Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as subclass(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). The - subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.
- Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of ‚Äúreusability‚Äù, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.

The symbol used for inheritance is :





2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
- Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class. A derived class can have only one direct base class. However, inheritance is transitive.
- No. Make a base class that has one method, one constructor and one destructor. It has three new members, plus the heritable members of its base class. Now derive a class from that. The constructor and destructor will not be inherited; all the other members will. Therefore it is possible to create a derived class which inherits only some of its base class's members.





3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
- A class can only achieve multiple inheritances through interfaces. Role of Access Modifiers in Inheritance. Access modifiers play an important role in inheritance. Access modifiers of each member in the base class impact their accessibility in the derived class.
