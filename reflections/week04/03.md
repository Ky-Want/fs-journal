## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
- The purpose of async / await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. The behavior of async / await is similar to combining generators and promises. Async functions always return a promise.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
- Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword before a call to a function that returns a promise. This makes the code wait at that point until the promise is settled, at which point the fulfilled value of the promise is treated as a return value, or the rejected value is thrown.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
- The main benefits of asynchronous programming using async / await include the following: Increase the performance and responsiveness of your application, particularly when you have long-running operations that do not require to block the execution.
