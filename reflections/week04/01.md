> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
- The cause of callback hell is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
- The asynchronous callback is executed after the execution of the higher-order function. Simply saying, the asynchronous callbacks are non-blocking: the higher-order function completes its execution without waiting for the callback. The higher-order function makes sure to execute the callback later on a certain event.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
- Keep your code shallow
- Modularize
- Handle every error
