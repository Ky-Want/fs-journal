# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern 

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
There are three major pillars on which object-oriented programming relies: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
staff.name 
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single responsibility principle.
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class - it's a concrete 'thing' that you made using a specific class.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A proxy object acts as an intermediary between the client and an accessible object. The purpose of the proxy object is to monitor the life span of the accessible object and to forward calls to the accessible object only if it is not destroyed.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A controller is responsible for controlling the way that a user interacts with an MVC application. A controller contains the flow control logic for an ASP.NET MVC application. A controller determines what response to send back to a user when a user makes a browser request.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A service layer is an additional layer in an ASP.NET MVC application that mediates communication between a controller and repository layer. The service layer contains business logic. In particular, it contains validation logic.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Model is the part of MVC which implements the domain logic. In simple terms, this logic is used to handle the data passed between the database and the user interface (UI). The Model is known as domain object or domain entity. 
```
