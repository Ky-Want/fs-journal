# Working in a Professional Environment
 
**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the concept that when a class of objects is defined, any subclass that is defined can inherit the definitions of one or more general classes.
```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.
In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Definition of Done (DoD) represents the organization's formal definition of quality for all Product Backlog Items (PBIs). If an organization does not have one, the Scrum team should set its own.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
- As Max, I want to invite my friends, so we can enjoy this service together. 
- As Sasha, I want to organize my work, so I can feel more in control. 
- As a manager, I want to be able to understand my colleagues progress, so I can better report our success and failures.
```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
- Scrum Ceremony #2: Sprint Planning.
- Every team sets the duration of their sprints themselves. But to start a sprint, the team must know what they are going to develop. This is exactly what the sprint planning ceremony is for. The team gathers and starts to pull items from their product backlog into the sprint backlog.
```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Daily Scrum.
